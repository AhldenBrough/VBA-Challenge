# VBA Challenge explanation and citations
This VBA script will take in a set of data containing stock tickers, opening, and closing prices as well as volume for each day. <br />
The yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock will be calculated and stored in a table along with the corresponding stock ticker. <br />
It will also calculate the the greatest percent increase and decrease as well as the gretest total volume for each sheet of stock data.  <br />
The function will work across multiple sheets of data. Lines 98-152 contain code from https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-conditional-formatting/ for applying conditional formatting to the yearly change and percentage change. <br />
The for loop structure for looping through multiple worksheets is based off of activity 6 from day 3 of the VBA scripting module from the UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp.
